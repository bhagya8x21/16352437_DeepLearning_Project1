Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation and experimentation with various deep learning concepts using the Neural Network Playground. It involves testing and training a neural network with different learning rates, optimizers, and other parameters to observe how they affect the performance, accuracy, and convergence of the model.

The main objectives of this project are:

To explore the impact of learning rates on the model's performance.
To analyze how different optimization algorithms affect training and accuracy.
To test various activation functions, layer configurations, and other deep learning features.

Features Tested:
This project involves testing the following deep learning features:

1. Learning Rate
Different learning rates (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, etc.) were tested to observe how the model converges during training. A lower learning rate may result in slower convergence but better accuracy, while a higher learning rate may lead to overshooting the optimal point.
2. Accuracy
Accuracy is measured after each epoch to evaluate how well the model is performing. We experiment with different configurations to observe how the learning rate, optimizer, and other factors influence the accuracy.
3. Optimization Algorithms
SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent): Basic optimization algorithm, widely used.
Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation): Optimizer that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter.
RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation): An optimizer that adjusts the learning rate based on a moving average of the squared gradients.
4. Activation Functions
Sigmoid: Common activation function, suitable for binary classification.
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Commonly used activation function for hidden layers in deep networks.
Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Often used for classification tasks.
5. Number of Layers & Units per Layer
Experimentation with different numbers of layers (1, 2, 3) and the number of neurons in each layer (e.g., 5, 10, 20) to observe how depth and complexity impact the performance.
6. Batch Size
Testing with different batch sizes (e.g., 32, 64, 128) to understand how it affects the speed of training and convergence.
Results and Observations
Learning Rate Effect:

A learning rate of 0.01 provided the best performance in terms of convergence and accuracy for the dataset used in this project.
Lower learning rates such as 0.001 showed slower but more stable convergence.
Higher learning rates like 0.1 resulted in overshooting and failure to converge.
Optimizer Performance:

Adam significantly outperformed both SGD and RMSprop in terms of accuracy and training time, especially for larger models.
SGD was slower and required more tuning for optimal results.
Activation Function Effect:

ReLU performed best for the hidden layers, leading to faster convergence and higher accuracy.
Sigmoid and Tanh were used in the output layer for classification tasks, with Sigmoid performing better for binary classification.
